## Agenda

### Announcements

## Matt & SBOMS
* https://cyclonedx.org/guides/
* https://sysdig.com/products/secure/
* https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos/issues/8
* #1 common use case -> vulnerabilities 
  * Ideally create report of vulnerabilities that are fixed
* Leads SBOM working group, looking to get all groups to create great quality SBOMS and the best utility to do so
  * Matt screenshared an example of his spec document for IBM might be a useful template or at least background for OpenJS
  * Automation in github, e.g. issues are automatically created for SBOM issues for releases
* Lots of the work Matt has done can be leveraged for the DESTF SBOM deliverable
* Matt -> hardest part, projects are not 100% a single language or ecosystem
* Jordan -> true but for packages (js) would mostly be single language
* Matt -> best place to start, find the right tool, test the tool, provide documentation on where you use it and how
* Node
  * Dependencies in SBOM would be good to call out but a lot harder (e.g. SSL), node probably special case
* CDXGEN - tool donated to OWASP
* Github looking at this space, they produce some dependency graphing tools that they are encouraging folks to add this to their github actions. Opt in. https://github.blog/2023-03-28-introducing-self-service-sboms/
* Chris -> Transitive dependencies (shaded packages), Matt -> typically off the shelf tooling wont find these things

## Package.json

* Joe -> group spinning up to tackle package.json
