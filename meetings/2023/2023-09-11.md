### openjs-foundation/security-collab-space

* Amir Montazery from OSTIF - let’s talk about audits! See also https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1094
   * Amir / OSTIF moving forward on audits for nvm, fastify, and webpack
   * Audits include collecting background information, reviewing automated testing, manual code review and actually implementing fixes, remediations,  root cause analysis
   * Example report: CNCF impact report.

* Discuss: Request for Information on Open-Source Software Security: Areas of Long-Term Focus and Prioritization [#53](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space/issues/53)
  * Ben and Robin will put together a draft for the group after Bilbao

* Get Feedback On Draft "OpenSSF Best Practices Badge for JS Projects" [#50](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space/issues/50)
   * Lots of feedback on the doc! One more review prior to publishing. 
   * OpenSSF very interested in upstreaming anything relevant 

* Create a prescriptive best practices toolchain [#45](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space/issues/45)
   * Feels like this would be good to implement post some of Jordan’s docs, potentially this becomes part of the DESTF workflow. 

* Milestone: Compliance Report / Audits / Dashboard Created And Populated By Tier 2 Projects [#17](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space/issues/17)
   * There are dashboards from openssf, nearform, and LF. Need to do some homework so that we are not re-inventing or duplicating effort. 

* Milestone: SBOM Generation /  Tooling Best Practices Created [#18](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space/issues/18)

Matt feedback re: expectation of projects for generating SBOMs:
Generate on release, packaged w/ distributable
Add a script (npm run) to generate on-demand in dev envs
Full dep. graph SBOM
